## pico8-tetris
In 2015 I wrote Tetris for the pico-8 fantasy console
right in the pico-8 UI, which wasn't that easy.  :)

I have no idea how this code works anymore and these names 
don't make this easy to understand.  I'm very impressed that
people can do fantastic things like dynamic lightning and full
3d engines within these restrictions.  Phenomenal stuff.
